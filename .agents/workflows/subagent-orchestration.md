# Subagent Orchestration Workflow

## Objective
Standardize safe delegation and parallelization behavior for Nest monorepo work.

## Steps
1. Keep the critical-path task local and use `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md` as
   the source of truth.
2. Delegate only independent side tasks such as docs sync, isolated tests, or
   clearly separated API, web, or mobile slices.
3. Assign clear file ownership, expected output, and required checks.
4. Continue local non-overlapping work while subagents run.
5. Integrate outputs, run validations, and sync task and project context.

## Guardrails
- no overlapping write ownership
- no duplicate implementation effort
- no blocking wait loops without reason
- no delegation of unclear or under-specified tasks
- no drift between delegated work and task board status
