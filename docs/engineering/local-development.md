# Local Development

## Fill This File Early

Document the real local development flow with concrete commands and expected
results.

Recommended minimum sections:
- prerequisites
- environment baseline (`.env` files, required variables, local endpoints)
- local services startup
- API startup
- web startup
- mobile startup
- local PROD-like startup (build plus start mode)
- verification checks for each mode
- shutdown and cleanup
- common troubleshooting notes

## Why It Matters

- reduces repeated setup questions
- keeps AI agents aligned with the actual local workflow
- makes validation commands more trustworthy
- improves confidence when validating behavior close to deployment runtime

## Verification Contract

- Define at least one health or readiness check command per runtime surface.
- Define at least one manual flow check for core user and operator paths.
- Clarify which local shortcuts are debugging-only and not deployment parity
  proof.

## Pair With

- `docs/engineering/testing.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

These three should agree on real commands and local runtime expectations.
